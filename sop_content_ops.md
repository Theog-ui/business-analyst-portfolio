# SOP: Content Evaluation & Business Analysis Workflow

**Purpose:** Deliver accurate, logically sound content/analyses on time.

## 1) Intake
- Use brief template (goal, inputs, constraints, due date, owner).
- Triage within 4 business hours; assign priority (P0/P1/P2).

## 2) Assignment & Setup
- Allocate tasks in ClickUp/Notion; each gets an ID.
- Create working files: `/scenarios.tsv`, `/qa_log.tsv`, `/outputs/<id>.md`.
- Define acceptance criteria and rubric up front.

## 3) Authoring
- For scenarios/cases: use TSV headers.
- For briefs/memos: use Markdown template; include KPI table.

## 4) QA (two‑step)
- **Peer review:** apply rubric; log issues in `qa_log.tsv`.
- **Lead review:** verify blocking issues fixed; record pass/fail + reason.

## 5) Delivery
- Share final MD/PDF + structured data (TSV/JSON/HTML/XML).
- Post status update with decisions and risks.

## 6) Metrics & Retros
- Track throughput, FPAR, TAT, error rate weekly.
- 15‑minute retro Fridays; update SOP based on findings.

**SLAs:** Intake 4h; P1 delivery 48–72h; QA turnaround 24h.  
**RACI:** Lead (Accountable), Author (Responsible), Peer (Responsible), Stakeholder (Consulted), PM (Informed).
