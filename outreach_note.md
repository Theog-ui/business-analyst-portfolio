Hi — I lead content ops like a business analyst: brief → acceptance criteria → two‑step QA → ship. 
Here’s a small portfolio (TSV/JSON/HTML/XML scenarios + QA rubric + SOP + metrics) showing how I structure work and raise quality while cutting TAT. 
I can overlap 4h with PST daily; happy to walk through the SOP and scorecard.
